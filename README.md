# Simplistic IP Pinger Customizable

This pinger is simple and customizable w/ bytes

bytes usage is for either sending higher packet rates or lower.
nothing of this is illegal, tho sending higher packet rates makes your connection usage higher. 
meaning you're sending a DoS attack. thats illegal, so use at your own free will and or to test
your networks speed.
